These are the files for the Huffman Encoding Lab. 
More information on this lab can be found at:https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/labs/lab10/index.html

Summary:

This lab is split up into two parts. In part 1, an input file is given. The frequencies of each letter are stored into a binary 
heap. A tree of prefix codes is built for each character depending on its frequency, with each path in the prefix code tree 
representing a single letter to be encoded. The source file is then read, and each characters prefix code is written to the output file. 

In part 2, an encoded file is given. The program first recreates the Huffman tree and then decodes the encoded input character by 
character back to its original form.
